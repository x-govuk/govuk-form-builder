markdown:
  Fieldsets are used to group related form elements. They are added
  automatically by the radio button, checkbox and date helpers but can be
  manually applied to other groups where applicable.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: 'A fieldset for capturing an address',
  code: address_fieldset) do

  markdown:
    A common use case for fieldsets is grouping address fields. The
    individual components of an address donâ€™t really make sense alone so
    grouping them is a logical step. The grouping also improves the experience
    for screen reader users, the screen reader will announce the legend
    before reading the individual field labels.

== render('/partials/related-navigation.*', links: fieldset_info)
