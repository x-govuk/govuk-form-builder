title: Injecting content
---

markdown:
  Sometimes a label, legend and hint donâ€™t give enough of an explanation as
  to why a question is being asked or what the consequences of answering it
  might be. In these cases, the form builder supports the injection of HTML
  into most helpers. This content is inserted after the hint and before the
  form control.

.govuk-inset-text
  markdown:
    Injected content is automatically associated with the element via its
    `aria-describedby` attribute allowing assistive technologies to provide the
    user with a full explanation of what is required.

markdown:
  The following helpers support content injection:

  * `#govuk_collection_check_boxes`
  * `#govuk_collection_radio_buttons`
  * `#govuk_collection_select`
  * `#govuk_date_field`
  * `#govuk_email_field`
  * `#govuk_error_summary`
  * `#govuk_file_field`
  * `#govuk_number_field`
  * `#govuk_password_field`
  * `#govuk_phone_field`
  * `#govuk_text_area`
  * `#govuk_text_field`
  * `#govuk_url_field`

  markdown:
    All content supplied via a block is considered supplementary to the label
    and hint.
