title: Textarea
---

markdown:
  Textareas allow users to enter text thatâ€™s longer than a single line.

  Users can find open-ended questions difficult to answer. It might be better
  to break up one complex question into a series of simple ones.

  caption: 'Generating a textarea with a label, hint and nine rows',
  code: text_area_with_label_and_hint_and_nine_rows)

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: 'Generating a textarea with a word limit',
  code: text_area_with_max_words) do

  markdown:
    If a limit on the number of words or characters a user can enter is
    required, the `max_chars` and `max_words` parameters can be used. They
    provide feedback on how close the user is to the limit and automatically
    show an error if it is exceeeded.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: 'Generating a textarea with a character limit and threshold',
  code: text_area_with_max_chars_and_threshold) do

  markdown:
    If the limit is much higher than most users are likely to reach, you can
    choose to only display the message after a user has entered a certain
    amount.

    To do this, set the `threshold` parameter in conjunction with a word or
    character limit.
