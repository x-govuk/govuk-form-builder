title: Date input
---

markdown:
  Date inputs allow the user to enter the day, month and year of an event.

  The date input’s parameters match those used by Rails’ `date_select` helper.
  To access the parameters in your controller you should just need to permit
  the attribute, for example:

  ```language-ruby
  # in UsersController

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:date_of_birth, ...)
  end
  ```

  Three inputs for day, month and year respectively are used to capture the
  dates rather than a date picker. This is because:

  * some users find date pickers difficult to use
  * often users will be expected to enter a date they know rather than to pick
    a date

  markdown:
    When asking for dates that the user might not know or could struggle to
    remember, such as their graduation date, the exact date might not be
    necessary. The day can be optionally omitted by providing the `omit_day`
    parameter.

    When mapped to a `Date` attribute, Ruby will automatically set the `Day` to
    be `1` when none is provided. This should be taken into account when
    displaying the data or using it for analysis.

  code: maxlength_enabled_field) do

  markdown:
    To enable client side restrictions on the number of characters each
    input requires, you can use the `maxlength_enabled` parameter. This will
    default the day and month inputs to 2 characters and the year input to 4
    characters.
